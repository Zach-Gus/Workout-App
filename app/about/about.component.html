            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">What do you enjoy most about working at Connecticut College?</h4>
                    I enjoy working with and connecting with athletes and coaches.  I also love being on campus and seeing some of the professors or staff members I knew from when I went to Conn!     
                    
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">How did you get to where you are today as being the Women's Assistant Soccer Coach and Strength and Conditioning Coach for all sports here at Connecticut College?</h4>
                    I graduated from Connecticut College in 2008 and immediately began teaching in New London.  I was a 5th and 6th grade teacher for 10 years.  In the spring of 2016, I realized that I missed being part of a team and missed soccer.  I contacted Norm Riker (Head Coach Women’s Soccer) and asked if I could help the team in any way.  During that spring, I created workouts for the soccer team and would take them on trail runs.  The next season, my role continued and I would go to practices and games with the team.  That spring, I realized that I really enjoyed coaching and would love to get into the strength and conditioning world.  I pursued a few different certifications over the next couple of years and now I’m here - working with 7 different teams!
                    
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">Why did you Choose Connecticut College?</h4>
                    For college:  I remember researching different colleges in the United States and coming across Connecticut College because of their elementary education certification program. I knew I wanted to be a teacher and play D3 soccer so I looked into it a bit more.  I loved the honor code and everything the college stood for so I decided to apply early decision.  My first day on campus (and in CT for that matter) was my freshmen move in day!
                    For work:  I had a wonderful experience as a student at Connecticut College and once I started getting involved with the soccer team, I knew I ultimately wanted to work here.  It all came full circle, I guess!
                    
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">What do you enjoy most about working with athletes? </h4>
                    I love seeing athletes work hard and strive to become better every single time they enter the weight room or start their practice.  I love the dedication they bring with them and the perseverance they have.  I also really enjoy making connections with them, learning from them, and hopefully inspiring them.
                    
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">Favorite healthy snack after a workout?</h4>
                    A rice cake topped with peanut butter and a sliced banana.
                    
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 15px">Fun fact about yourself?</h4>
                    I can walk on my hands and can hold a handstand.
